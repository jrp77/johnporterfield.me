<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="334" data-line-end="335">I think I should finally process last night. I’m not entirely sure if words will do it justice.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="336" data-line-end="337">This week has been one of the roughest on my emotional state. Not only have the Step Sing rehearsals been long and draining, I was a jerk to Isabel three times in a row. The third time was last night. There was a huge miscommunication due entirely because of my inability to listen.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="338" data-line-end="339">All of it hit me like a truck when we got back to her apartment. I felt like a shell of myself. I could not believe how terrible of a boyfriend I had been over the last week.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="340" data-line-end="341">I fully expected the conversation to go in the worst possible way. “You’ve been a jerk, and I just can’t do this anymore”. I cam clean about how exhausted I was, how deeply my mistakes had been haunting me, and apologized not expecting to be forgiven.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="342" data-line-end="343">What happened next was one of the greatest acts of love I have ever experienced. When she had the opportunity to hurt me more, she comforted me. She held me and told me it was going to be alright, that she wasn’t mad at me, and that I should go home and sleep.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="344" data-line-end="345">I collected my stuff, thanked her a thousand times it seems, and barely made it to my car before I started weeping.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="346" data-line-end="347">She had every right to be frusturated at my lack of emotional avalibility over the course of the last week. But instead of being pragmatic, she showed me grace, and sending me home to sleep was the most caring thing she could have done for me.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="348" data-line-end="349">I wept the whole way back to Samford. I did not deserve this love whatsoever, and yet it was still shown to me. She embodied my Savior and the way He loves me, and not only do I feel more confident about Isabel and I’s relationship, but I feel more drawn to God than I have felt since Vesper Point this summer.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="350" data-line-end="351">In my last relationship, I felt like I did the lionshare of ther loving. But [it] has been so long since I felt so deeply loved, and from my girlfriend who I’ve only been dating for two months.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="352" data-line-end="353"><s>I think</s> I love you, Isabel. Thank you so much for loving me at my lowest. You have no idea how deeply you have calmed my soul. I’m going to make it up to you I promise.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="354" data-line-end="355">I feel so compelled to follow Christ now. My life feels full again, and now I know I do not walk these struggles alone. I am so much more emphatically forgiven by my Savior if Isabel has shown me so much as a fraction of what it looks like.</p>
