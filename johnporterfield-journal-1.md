John, 
I know you're not a big writer, but here's somewhere to put your thoughts :)

Incredibly thankful for this journal to write these thoughts. Thank you Isabel, you are the best :)

Sad that I am growing older, but thankful that God is shaping me into the person I was supposed to be.

My relationship with God has been on the back burner.

That changes tonight.

Looking forward to pursuing His Presence now and in 2022.

"The story of amazing love, Light of the world, given for us."

Polychromatic VIew of Christmas
	- 1 John -> God IS light
	- Jesus coming to Earth shows us that God is light
- - **red lights -> blood of Christ**
	- God = holy/just/powerful AND merciful
- **blue lights -> lamenting over sin**
	- Christmas = no purpose unless we see it in light of our sin
	- John -> we have loved darkness more than light
- **white lights -> Jesus concieved without sin, reminds us of His purity**
	- Jesus gave His blood to wash us right as snow
- **green lights -> we all must decide what we are going to do with Christ (Chi Rho), growth
	- Paul -> if belief is not genuine, we ?
	- if true, give up your life for Christ (Chi Rho)
	- if not, go on your merry way
- In January, trees go down and lights turn off, but Christ (Chi Rho) never leaves
- All lights in world will dim, but Christ's light surpasses all

"Silent night! Holy night! Son of God, love's pure light."

"For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord"
-Luke 2:11

Today is the most un-Christmas Christmas in a long time, maybe that's just a part of getting older.

"Possibility rich, permanance poor"

Thankful to enjoy spending time with my family this time around :)

Thinking a lot about time and the passing of.

Isabel's grandfather about to pass away, RoRo getting older, noticing my parents aging, I'm about to be a real adult.

This world is temporary.
Christ is forever.
Fixing eyes on Kingdom to come.

I like being able to scribble down thoughts.

Thank you Isabel.

Enjoying time spent with my friends, thankful for such strong Christian community.

Need to pray for member of Brodie's small group who is going through deep depression. This is also taking an emotional toll on Brodie.

Feels like Christ (Chi Rho) is abandoning him.

We can only create the environment for the Lord to work through, Christ (Chi Rho) will do the rest.

I really like Isabel and I've loved getting to spend time with her / her family today.

I feel stung however when her response to a story/comment I make is, "It's because you have **money**". This is the last thing I want to focus on in conversation.

I have been incredibly blessed to have a dad that has worked this hard to provide his family with safety, financial security, and a quality education. Because of this, I have lived a life most people do not, and I am eternally grateful.

I feel like this is coming up more frequently than it should in conversation. I want to love her well, but I feel hindered by the emotions I experience after each of these remarks.

It helps build a case in my head that she likes me more for the money I have than the person I am.

I don't want to focus on our differences, I want to prioritize our shared experience and have a relationship that glorifies the Lord.

I care for Isabel and I don't want to hurt her, I don't know what to do.

(transcription note: I actually wrote 1/2/2021 at the top, this happens every year doesn't it)

"Yet not I, but through Christ in me."

Ezekiel 37:1-10
	- Southern kingdom of Judah in captivity, "Where is God?"
	- People suffering
	- Ezekiel -> Why are you putting me in this place?
1. Place
	- even though we live in Bible Belt, Christianity is becoming more of a minority religion
	- where will you stand? Can you identify the valley?
	- "Son of man, can these bones live?" (vs 3)
	- Dry bones cannot come back to life, not without a **miracle**
2. Power
	- Moses pleaded with God that he was not the right person for the job, Jonah doubted God's providence, Paul previously persecuting Christians (Chi Rho), **but God intercedes for us**
	- Ezekiel -> "Oh Lord, you know" (vs 3b)
		- Can we respond to our valleys in this manner?
	- Ezekiel prophesies to bones, and God gives them life
	- Breath here can also mean "pour His Spirit"
3. Preach
	- "Who am I to share the Gospel?"
	- anyone can share the Good News of Christ (Chi Rho), you never know the size of the tree when you plant the seed
4. Pray
	- two phased restoration
	- preaching started, prayer made it a reality
	- go to God in prayer first

Spur of the moment I went over to Isabel's place tonight to watch a movie / hang out. It ended up being some of the most productive conversation we've had so far.

Earlier I wrote about how it hurt a little bit whenever she would say, "It's because you have money." I told her about that and we had a really good conversation about how we could treat each other best even though we come from wildly different childhoods and upbringings.

I'm incredibly thankful to be dating someone this mature :)
### January 7, 2022 - 9:22pm
I hate being my own worst critic. Being able to learn from mistakes is a good thing, but I feel like I'm so happy in the moment of casting, but afterwards a little man on my shoulders keeps nitpicking me.

I see this in my relationship with Isabel also, a relationship is where both people are comfortable being themselves, and I feel attacked by someone (NOT ISABEL) every time I speak.

Need to build confidence.

-JP
### January 17, 2022 - 1:50pm
Long time no see.
Need to not leave journal at home for a week.

Feeling very motivated to improve my casting today. This normally happens after I think I did poorly on broadcast.

Time to use this week to create a new casting strategy.

I also need to carry this over to my spiritual life. Quiet time in the morning starts tomorrow.

"And Jesus said to them, 'Follow me, and I will make you **become** fishers of men'"
-Mark 1:17, ESV

I have always heard "fishers **of** men" and missed that first part. It is not a snap of a finger and then suddenly we are furthering God's Kingdom, it is a process that only Christ can help us grow towards.

Especially since I'm in this disheartened state as of recent, I am incredibly encouraged by this. How I have missed the simplicity of the Bread of Life.

Last night was rough, and it was for the most part my fault. I started two conversations at poor times and really frusturated Isabel. I'm thankful she told me afterwards how that made her feel, but I'm left carrying a strange feeling of guilt into this morning.

Need to learn from mistakes and let go of these feelings, but they are sticking way more than they should.

Have a feeling the Lord called me back to him before things got rough.

In a very unsurprising turn, Zack has not payed his Samford bill and is now unenrolled from all classes this semester.

Just very confused and realizing Isabel / Sierra were right about a lot.

Zack's a good guy with good intentions, just very immature.

Need to spend time in the Word today. Things are getting a lot harder very quickly.

-JP
### January 21, 2022 - 2:22am
You absolute dunce!

That's two nights in a row you've been a jerk to Isabel. Come on now, man.

I'm so incredibly thankful she still likes me, surely now a bit less after the things I've said. I didn't have to say any of what I did to Isabel and I did. I am incredibly embarrassed, this is not who I am.

Lord help me grow and love Isabel the way she deserves. I have so much room to grow.

-JP
### January 22, 2022 - 12:22am
My CSB Study Bible came in today, so this was my first time doing quiet time with it.

It makes a very interesting point that no one against Jesus' ministry denied his power, but they attributed it to Satan instead, to which Christ (Chi Rho) rebukes them saying "If a kingdom is divided, the kingdom cannot stand." (Mk 3:24)

Christ couldn't be Satan and cast out demons because that would be Satan defeating himself which would cheapen God's power. So freaking cool.

Not much sleep last night, sometimes my brain just works too hard and cannot accept that it's time to stop.

These rehearsals are really draining me. Need to remember to rest as much as possible.

Love all my brothers. They are pulling me through this.

Talked with Wesley about things with Isabel and he really encouraged me.

[transcription note: there are three blank lines at the top, as I had likely left them to record the title of the message / who was speaking but I forgot to.]

1. God embraced the hard cost of reconciliation so that all that is left is reunion with Him.
	- The pain God embraced to bring us peace means the pain we endure is not punishment
	- What are you using to grade your relationship with God?
	- If you build your life on a sense, *fragility results*.
	- If you build your life on the "since" of Sil, *resiliency results*.
	- We do not need to add the frown of God to our burdens. He shed His blood to rescue us from this
	- People who feel no threat from heaven feel no threat on earth
2. The Spirit God gives means the path to future glory is laced with love and has no loopholes
	- Suffering maintains that the journey will end in joy
	- Suffering drives us to God so that the line between prayer and the rest of life blurs
	- Maybe our obsessions with Earthly things are just as crazy as taking a hot air balloon
3. The illogical love of God displayed at the cross means hope has now become logical
	- God stretches our categories beyond compare
	- Christ dies not for His friends, but for His foes
	- Our hope is tethered to God's inclination to love us not our conditon to be loved by Him
	- "Surely there is no worse sight than the human body unloved"
	- Our bodies may be fragile, but let our souls be resilient
4. The resurrected Christ guarantees our future reunion with God will be wonderful
	- Condemnation has no place in the court of heaven
	- Wonderful love is all that awaits us in Christ

I think I should finally process last night. I'm not entirely sure if words will do it justice.

This week has been one of the roughest on my emotional state. Not only have the Step Sing rehearsals been long and draining, I was a jerk to Isabel three times in a row. The third time was last night. There was a huge miscommunication due entirely because of my inability to listen.

All of it hit me like a truck when we got back to her apartment. I felt like a shell of myself. I could not believe how terrible of a boyfriend I had been over the last week.

I fully expected the conversation to go in the worst possible way. "You've been a jerk, and I just can't do this anymore". I cam clean about how exhausted I was, how deeply my mistakes had been haunting me, and apologized not expecting to be forgiven.

What happened next was one of the greatest acts of love I have ever experienced. When she had the opportunity to hurt me more, she comforted me. She held me and told me it was going to be alright, that she wasn't mad at me, and that I should go home and sleep.

I collected my stuff, thanked her a thousand times it seems, and barely made it to my car before I started weeping.

She had every right to be frusturated at my lack of emotional avalibility over the course of the last week. But instead of being pragmatic, she showed me grace, and sending me home to sleep was the most caring thing she could have done for me.

I wept the whole way back to Samford. I did not deserve this love whatsoever, and yet it was still shown to me. She embodied my Savior and the way He loves me, and not only do I feel more confident about Isabel and I's relationship, but I feel more drawn to God than I have felt since Vesper Point this summer.

In my last relationship, I felt like I did the lionshare of ther loving. But [it] has been so long since I felt so deeply loved, and from my girlfriend who I've only been dating for two months.

~~I think~~ I love you, Isabel. Thank you so much for loving me at my lowest. You have no idea how deeply you have calmed my soul. I'm going to make it up to you I promise.

I feel so compelled to follow Christ now. My life feels full again, and now I know I do not walk these struggles alone. I am so much more emphatically forgiven by my Savior if Isabel has shown me so much as a fraction of what it looks like.
### January 24, 2022 - 9:52am
Very stressed, lots of work and not enough time.

Going to need to be very productive today and Wednesday.

Why has every teacher decided to make every assignment due the week of Step Sing? Goodness me.

AND Isabel's birthday is this week and that is an event that I should put effort into.

It's all going to work out. It may be trivial but the Lord is small enough to carry me through this.

Prayers for Patrick Bush
	- intentionality with ministry
	- internally an emotional basketcase, affects PBs heart
	- are we improving or degrading the health of the ministry?
	- don't let emotions affect role in God's kingdom
	- wisdom to discern things that are less healthy
	- kids learning remotely, less productive when at home
	- -need more applicants for summer, only 2 girl applicants and 1 guy applicant (me), juggling that with conference speaking
	- planning for summer (Edge, beach trip, St Louis, etc)

### January 24, 2022 - 4:39pm
Wow. Lots of thoughts today. I'm either in a state where I can process my emotions well or life sucks. You flip a coin, but I don't think it's the latter.

I internally read-between-the-lines of every situation. I hate that everything I do / that is done to me occupies my headspace for so long.

You're doing great, John. Do not worry. It'll be alright.

(maybe it is the latter I don't know)
